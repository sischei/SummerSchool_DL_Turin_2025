Summer School on [Deep Learning for Economics and Finance](https://sites.google.com/carloalberto.org/thesummerschool2025unito/home?authuser=0), held at [ESOMAS](https://www.esomas.unito.it/do/home.pl), August 25 - 27, 2025, at the University of Torino. 


## Purpose of the lectures

* This summer school is designed for Ph.D. students and reseaerchers in economics and related disciplines. It
introduces recent advancements in machine learning, computational
science, and the computational economics and finance literature. 
* The course focuses on solving and estimating dynamic stochastic economic models, and solving continuous-time models (that is, partial differential equations).
* The lectures will concentrate on machine learning methodologies, including Deep Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, Physics-informed Neural Nets. These methods will be explored through applications in macroeconomics, finance, and climate-change economics.
* The format of the lectures will be interactive and workshop-like, combining theoretical discussions with hands-on coding exercises. 
* The coding will be conducted in Python and implemented on a cloud computing infrastructure [Nuvolos](https://nuvolos.com).


## Prerequisites

* Basic econometrics.
* Basic programming in Python (see [this link to QuantEcon](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) for a thorough introduction).
* A brief Python refresher is provided [under this link](python_refresher).
* A brief Python on Jupyter Notebooks is provided [under this link](python_refresher/jupyter_intro.ipynb). 
* Basic calculus and probability (The book [Mathematics for Machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) provides a good overview of skills participants are required to be fluent in). 


## Class enrollment on the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/)

* All lecture materials (slides, codes, and further readings) will be distributed via the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/).
* To enroll in this class, please click on this [enrollment key](https://app.nuvolos.cloud/enroll/class/_lQSiRolH94), and follow the steps.
